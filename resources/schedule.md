An Xplenty **schedule** executes packages periodically starting at a specified date and time. The packages will be executed as scheduled, using an existing cluster that fits the scheduled cluster size or if one doesn't exist, a cluster will be provisioned automatically with the number of specified nodes. By default, the cluster is taken down as soon as package execution is completed.
